# Killaura Video

This is a killaura implementation that I am currently
working on and that I might make future videos on.

## Usage

Type the `/toggle killaura` command in-game. Currently, there
is no way to change the default settings, but I will add
that in the near future.

As of writing this, the Killaura is configured by default
to have a reach of 3.0 and an attack range of 30 degrees
from the player's vision, in an attempt to be as "legit"
as possible (Vulkan still hates me tho LOL).

There is a also a `sprintreset` module, which you can
toggle in the same way. (It's quite buggy though, for now,
working more like a toggle-sprint than anything else).

## Feedback, Issues, Ideas

If you have any feedback regarding the code's quality
or ways I could implement this better, as well as
any issues and any ideas that you may wish to share with
me, please open an issue or contact me on my Discord / on my
email, which should be attached to my Github profile.
